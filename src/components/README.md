<h1>Components</h1>

Houses smaller base level components that should be broken down as small as possible. In some case can be a combination of smaller components. An example might be an "textfield" and "label" component that are combined into one. If needed, a subfolder should be created to better categorize and organize files. Currently there are two pre-defined folders, "ui" and "icons".

Once a grouping of several components are combined for a more specific purpose, it should be moved to "features" folder if not there already.
